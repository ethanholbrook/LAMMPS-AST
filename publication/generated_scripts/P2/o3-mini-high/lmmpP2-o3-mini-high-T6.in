# LAMMPS Input Script for Melting Bulk Ni
# 
# This script simulates the melting of a bulk Ni sample.
# - The Ni unit cell (fcc) is replicated 10 times in each direction.
# - Initial velocities are assigned from a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution at 600 K.
# - The simulation is run under NPT (isothermal-isobaric) conditions (target pressure ~1 atm)
#   while heating the system continuously from 300 K to 2500 K at a rate of 10 K/ps.
#
# The interatomic interactions are described by the EAM potential for Ni developed by 
# Mishin et al. (1999) (v005, OpenKIM: doi:10.25950/a88dfc37).
#
# Note: In metal units, time is in ps, distance in Å, energy in eV, and pressure in GPa.
# 1 atm ≈ 0.0001013 GPa.
